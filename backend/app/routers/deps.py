Auth dependencies shared across routers.

``current_user`` resolves the Bearer access token to a ``User``. ``require_role``
builds a dependency that additionally enforces a minimum role. When
``AUTH_MODE=none`` (local dev / CI without auth) a synthetic admin user is
returned so protected routes stay reachable.
