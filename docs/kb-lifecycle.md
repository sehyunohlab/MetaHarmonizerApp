# KB lifecycle: build → publish → consume → refresh

The engine's knowledge base (FAISS + SQLite indexes over NCIt / UBERON / EFO)
and the embedding models are large and built **out-of-band**, then shipped as
one offline bundle (`kb_offline_bundle.tar.gz`). Running instances **seed** that
bundle — they never build it.

The exact maintainer order is `build_kb` → `warm_schema_cache` → `package_kb`.
Packaging is fail-closed: it will not publish a bundle missing a required
corpus, FAISS index/ID sidecar, engine database, embedding model, or schema
cache. Import validates the archive before extraction and verifies the installed
assets afterward.

## Refresh pipeline (`.github/workflows/kb-refresh.yml`)

Runs on an **ephemeral GitHub runner** (manual `workflow_dispatch` or a quarterly
cron). Nothing runs on your laptop or the prod server — the runner fetches,
builds, compresses, uploads, then is destroyed.

  subgraph R["GitHub runner (ephemeral VM)"]
    B["build_kb\n(downloads + embeds)"] --> P["package_kb\n(tar + gzip)"]
  end
  NCI["NCI EVSREST"] --> B
  OLS["OLS4 / EBI"] --> B
  HF["HuggingFace models"] --> B
  P --> REL["kb-latest Release asset\n(persistent, public URL)"]
  P --> PR["PR: bump KB_BUNDLE_SHA256"]
```

- **Downloads / requests** happen on the runner during `build_kb`: NCIt via
  EVSREST, UBERON via OLS4, models from HuggingFace (+ optional
  `UMLS_API_KEY` secret for synonym enrichment — base corpora fetch key-free).
- **Tar / compress** via `package_kb` → `kb/kb_offline_bundle.tar.gz`.
- **Upload** to the `kb-latest` GitHub Release (`gh release upload --clobber`),
  then a PR bumps `KB_BUNDLE_SHA256` so the download integrity check stays valid.
  When GitHub won't let Actions open the PR, an issue links to it instead (see
  [Automation pull requests](release-process.md#automation-pull-requests)).
- **Report** in the GitHub Actions summary: per-corpus rows, added/removed IDs,
  relabeled IDs, and before/after mapping-quality metrics. The same evidence,
  including affected ID lists, is retained for 90 days as JSON/CSV artifacts.

The cold ontology build is inherently compute- and network-heavy. Historical
clean runs took about 3 hours 20 minutes; a successful retry reusing the
pre-graft checkpoint completed in about 8 minutes. That cost belongs to the
quarterly maintainer workflow, never to deployment or a user's first task. The
workflow exposes `reuse_run_id` so a failed graft/package/publish phase reuses
the expensive build checkpoint instead of rebuilding all ontologies.

## Consume (every instance, local or prod)

```
docker compose --profile kb run --rm kb-import   # download from KB_BUNDLE_URL + verify sha256 + seed volumes
docker compose up --build                        # api/worker load the KB + models offline (HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1)
```

The import command runs `scripts.kb_probe` for disease/NCIt, bodysite/UBERON,
and treatment/NCIt. `/readyz` reports `ontology_kb=ok` only after the same
contract passes, and ontology submissions receive HTTP 503 before upload if it
does not. The worker repeats the check for jobs inserted outside the API.

The bundle is a **point-in-time snapshot**; studies are stamped with the
schema/ontology version they were harmonized against (`SchemaVersion` /
`OntologySnapshot`) so results stay reproducible even after a later refresh.
Learned decisions live in PostgreSQL and are not replaced by a bundle refresh.
The impact report identifies removed or relabeled ontology IDs that may require
an administrator to review corresponding learned targets.
